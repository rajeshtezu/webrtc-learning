## TURN server

- Since a direct socket is often not possible between the clients (unless they reside on the same local network)
- TURN (Traversal Using Relay NAT) : protocol for relaying network traffic.

- There are currently several options for TURN servers available online, both as self-hosted applications (like the open-source COTURN project) and as cloud provided services.

- Once you have a TURN server available online, all you need is the correct RTCConfiguration for your client application to use it. 

    Eg:
    ```
      const iceConfiguration = {
        iceServers: [
          {
            urls: 'turn:my-turn-server.mycompany.com:19403',
            username: 'optional-username',
            credentials: 'auth-token'
          }
        ]
      }

      const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(iceConfiguration);
    ```
