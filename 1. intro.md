# WebRTC - Realtime communication for the web

- With WebRTC, you can add real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard.
- The technologies behind WebRTC are implemented as an open web standard and available as regular JavaScript APIs in all major browsers.

**Note**: For native clients, like Android and iOS applications, a library is available that provides the same functionality.

## Application flow

- A WebRTC application will usually go through a common application flow. Accessing the media devices, opening peer connections, discovering peers, and start streaming.

## WebRTC APIs

- The WebRTC standard covers, on a high level, two different technologies:
  1. `media capture devices` and
  2. `peer-to-peer connectivity`
- For `cameras` and `microphones` : `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` to capture `MediaStreams`
- For `screen recording` : `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()`
- The peer-to-peer connectivity is handled by : `RTCPeerConnection`
  - This is the central point for establishing and controlling the connection between two peers in WebRTC.
