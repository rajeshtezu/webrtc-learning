## Media capture and constraints

- Media devices : navigator.mediaDevices

 - Constraints : 
    - When accessing media devices, it is a good practice to provide as detailed constraints as possible. While it is possible to open the default camera and microphone with a simple constraint, it might deliver a media stream that is far from the most optimal for the application.

    - The specific constraints are defined in a "MediaTrackConstraint" object, one for "audio" and one for "video".
    - Attribute type : ConstraintLong, ConstraintBoolean, ConstraintDouble, ConstraintDOMString
    - These can either be a specific value, range, or object
        Eg:

            // Camera with a resolution as close to 640x480 as possible
            {
              "video": {
                "width": 640,
                "height": 480
              }
            }

            or

            // Camera with a resolution in the range 640x480 to 1024x768
            {
              "video": {
                "width": {
                  "min": 640,
                  "max": 1024
                },
                "height": {
                  "min": 480,
                  "max": 768
                }
              }
            }

            or

            // Camera with the exact resolution of 1024x768
            {
              "video": {
                "width": {
                  "exact": 1024
                },
                "height": {
                  "exact": 768
                }
              }
            }

    - MediaStreamTrack.getSettings() : To determine the actual configuration a certain track of a media stream has. Returns the "MediaTrackSettings" currently applied.

    - applyConstraints() : update the constraints of a track from a media device we have opened, by calling on track


## Display media

- getDisplayMedia() : To perform screen capturing and recording. The returned MediaStream works the same as when using getUserMedia().
    - The constraints for getDisplayMedia() differ from the ones used for regular video or audio input.

    Eg:

        {Â 
          video: {
            cursor: 'always' | 'motion' | 'never',
            displaySurface: 'application' | 'browser' | 'monitor' | 'window'
          }
        }

        Note: These might not be supported by all browsers that have display media support.


## Streams and tracks

- A MediaStream represents a stream of media content, which consists of tracks (MediaStreamTrack) of audio and video. 
- You can retrieve all the tracks from MediaStream by calling MediaStream.getTracks(), which returns an array of MediaStreamTrack objects.

- MediaStreamTrack properties :
  - kind : Either audio or video, indicating the kind of media it represents. 
  - enabled : Each track can be muted by toggling this property.
  - remote : indicates if a track is sourced by a RTCPeerConnection and coming from a remote peer.
