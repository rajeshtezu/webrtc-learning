## Real-time communication for the web

- With WebRTC, you can add real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard.
- he technologies behind WebRTC are implemented as an open web standard and available as regular JavaScript APIs in all major browsers.
- For native clients, like Android and iOS applications, a library is available that provides the same functionality.

## Application flow

- A WebRTC application will usually go through a common application flow. Accessing the media devices, opening peer connections, discovering peers, and start streaming.

### WebRTC APIs

- The WebRTC standard covers, on a high level, two different technologies: media capture devices and peer-to-peer connectivity.

    - For cameras and microphones : navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() to capture MediaStreams
    - For screen recording        : navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()
    - The peer-to-peer connectivity is handled by : RTCPeerConnection 
        - This is the central point for establishing and controlling the connection between two peers in WebRTC.
