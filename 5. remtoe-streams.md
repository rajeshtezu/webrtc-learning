## Getting started with remote streams

- Once a RTCPeerConnection is connected to a remote peer, it is possible to stream audio and video between them.
- This is the point where we connect the stream we receive from getUserMedia() to the RTCPeerConnection.
- A media stream consists of at least one media track, and these are individually added to the RTCPeerConnection when we want to transmit the media to the remote peer.

  Eg:

  ```
    const localStream = await getUserMedia({video: true, audio: true});
    const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(iceConfig);
    localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
      peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream);
    });
  ```

  Note: Tracks can be added to a RTCPeerConnection before it has connected to a remote peer. so it makes sense to perform this setup as early as possible instead of waiting for the connection to be completed.

### Adding remote tracks

- To receive the remote tracks that were added by the other peer, we register a listener on the local RTCPeerConnection listening for the track event.
- The "RTCTrackEvent" contains an array of "MediaStream" objects that have the same "MediaStream.id" values as the peer's corresponding local streams.

- Note: while "MediaStream" IDs match on both sides of the peer connection, the same is generally not true for "MediaStreamTrack" IDs.

  Eg:

  ```
    const remoteVideo = document.querySelector('#remoteVideo');
    peerConnection.addEventListener('track', async (event: RTCTrackEvent) => {
      const [remoteStream] = event.streams;
      remoteVideo.srcObject = remoteStream;
    });
  ```
